Oxford, Bodleian Library, Canonicianus Class. Lat. 30.

Northern Italy (probably Verona), 14th century.   Italian Gothic minuscule (rotunda); scribe unidentified.   Parchment.   i + 37 + i folios.   270 x 199 (194 x 90) mm.   31 or 32 lines to the page.   1r-37v: Catullus, Carmina. Incomplete: no titles, and only a handful of initials and marginal notes have been added.   It is a matter of controversy whether the marginalia on fols. 1r-1v and 21r are by the first hand.   The historiated initial on folio 1r is somewhat later than the text; it may have been added to the manuscript in Lombardy around 1430.   O was copied from the lost archetype A.
